üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
. Programming Language: Python
. GUI Framework: Tkinter
. Database: MySQL (using pymysql library for database connectivity)

üìã Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.8 or above
2. MySQL Server
3. Python packages:
- pymysql
- tkinter (built into Python)

  ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/HarryVuthy/My-final-project.git

cd library-management-system

2. Set Up the MySQL Database:
- Create a database called LibrarySystem in MySQL

CREATE DATABASE LibrarySystem;

CREATE TABLE Books (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    available_copies INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Loans (
    loan_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id INT NOT NULL,
    book_id INT NOT NULL,
    loan_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES Members(member_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES Books(book_id)
);

3. Install Required Python Libraries:

  pip install mysql

4.Update Database Credentials: Open the finalproject.py file and update the connect_db function with your MySQL credentials:
def connect_db():
    return pymysql.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="your-mysql-username",
        password="your-mysql-password",
        database="LibrarySystem"
    )
5. Run the application:
python finalproject.py
